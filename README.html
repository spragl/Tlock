<h1>tlock</h1>

<h3>Locking with timeouts.</h3>

<p>tlock is handling "tlocks", advisory locks with timeouts.</p>

<p>They are implemented as simple directories that are created and deleted in the lock directory.</p>

<p>A distant predecessor was written many years ago as a kludge to make locking work properly on a Windows server. But it turned out to be very handy to have tlocks in the filesystem, giving you an at-a-glance overview of them. And giving the non-scripting sysadmins easy access to view and manipulate tlocks.</p>

<pre><code># taking a tlock for 5 minutes
token=$(tlock take 'logwork' 300 || exit 1)

move_old_index

# hand over to that other script
/usr/local/logrotate/logrotate $token

-----------------------------------------------------------

# checking lock is alive
token=$1
tlock alive 'logwork' $token || exit 1

# Make time for the fancy rotation task.
tlock renew 'logwork' 600

do_fancy_log_rotation 547
/usr/local/cleaning/clean-up-logs.sh $token

# releasing the lock
tlock release 'logwork' $token
</code></pre>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>There are a number of ways tlock parameters can be set, The prioritized list is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Directly on the command line with options "-d", "-m" and "-p".</p></li>
<li><p>Environment variables "tlock<em>dir", "tlock</em>marker" and "tlock_patience".</p></li>
<li><p>Configuration file given by the environment variable "tlock_conf".</p></li>
<li><p>Configuration file "/etc/tlock.conf".</p></li>
<li><p>Default configuration.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>In the file system</h2>

<p>Each tlock is a subdirectory of the lock directory. Their names are "$marker.$label". The default value for $marker is "tlock".</p>

<p>Each of the tlock directories has a sub directory named "d". The mtimes of these two directories saves the token and the timeout.
There also are some very shortlived directories named "$marker_.$label". They are per label master locks. They help making changes to the normal locks atomic.</p>

<h2>Command line</h2>

<p>tlock [-<option> [parameter]] <command> [parameter ...]</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<p>-d <d>  Set the lock directory to <d>.
-h      Show help text.
-m <m>  Set marker to <m>.
-p <p>  Set patience to <p>.
-V      Show the version.</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>

<p><strong>tlock take <label> <timeout> [<patience>]</strong>
Takes the specified tlock if possible. Returns the token value.</p>

<p><strong>tlock renew <label> <token> <timeout></strong>
Renews the tlock.</p>

<p><strong>tlock release <label> <token></strong>
Releases the tlock.</p>

<p><strong>tlock alive <label> <token></strong>
Returns true if the specified tlock is still alive.</p>

<p><strong>tlock taken <label></strong>
Returns true if any tlock with the given label, is alive.</p>

<p><strong>tlock expiry <label></strong>
Returns the time when the tlock with the given label will expire.</p>

<p><strong>tlock zing</strong>
Cleans up the lock directory.</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<p><strong>dir</strong>
The directory containing the tlocks.</p>

<p><strong>marker</strong>
The common prefix of the directory names used for tlocks.</p>

<p>Prefixes can be any non-empty string consisting of letters a-z or A-Z, digits 0-9, dashes "-" and underscores "_" (PCRE: [a-zA-Z0-9-_]+). First character has to be a letter, and last character a letter or digit.</p>

<p><strong>patience</strong>
Patience is the time a method will try to take or change a tlock, before it gives up. For example when tlock_take tries to take a tlock that is already taken, it is the number of seconds it should wait for that tlock to be released before giving up.</p>

<p>Default patience value is 2.5 seconds.,</p>

<h2>One tlock, multiple scripts</h2>

<p>The point of having tokens is to be able to hand over locks between scripts in a secure way. These scripts can be written in different languages. But they have to use the same dir and marker settings.</p>
